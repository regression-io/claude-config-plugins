# Documentation Rules

## Code Documentation
- Document why, not what (code shows what)
- Every public API needs documentation
- Include examples for non-obvious usage
- Keep docs close to code (same file when possible)

## README Essentials
- Project purpose and problem it solves
- Quick start (install, configure, run)
- Key features and limitations
- Links to detailed documentation

## API Documentation
- All endpoints with HTTP method and path
- Request/response schemas with examples
- Authentication requirements
- Error responses and codes
- Rate limits if applicable

## Architecture Documentation
- High-level system overview
- Key design decisions and rationale
- Component interactions (diagrams help)
- Data flow for critical paths

## Inline Comments
- Explain complex algorithms or business logic
- Note workarounds with issue references
- Mark TODOs with context and owner
- Never comment out code (delete it, git remembers)

## Documentation Maintenance
- Update docs with code changes
- Review docs in code review
- Date-stamp or version architecture docs
- Remove outdated documentation
